â”œâ”€â”€ .env                   # Environment variables
```

## Installation
1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
4. Configure the `.env` file if needed
5. Start the development server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

## Usage
- The frontend communicates with the backend via REST API (see backend README)
- All music management, search, and download features are available from the UI
- User authentication is required for most features

## ðŸ”‘ Authentication

Authentication is handled using **JWT**, stored on the frontend.

* The token is attached in headers (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
* Some routes (e.g., `/home/recently-played`, `/home/playlists`) require a logged-in user.

---

## ðŸ“š Main Pages

* **Home**:

  * Recently played tracks
  * User playlists
* **Library**:

  * Downloaded or local music
* **Player**:

  * Playback controls (Play / Pause / Next / Previous)
* **Login / Register**:

  * Backend authentication (JWT)

## ðŸ§ª Useful Scripts

* `npm run dev` â†’ Start the project in development mode
* `npm run build` â†’ Build the project for production
* `npm run preview` â†’ Preview the production build locally

## ðŸ“± iOS App Development

This project now includes iOS app development using Capacitor. The iOS app uses the same React codebase as the web version.

### iOS Setup Requirements

1. **macOS** with Xcode 14+ installed
2. **Ruby 3.1+** (for CocoaPods)
3. **CocoaPods** installed

### iOS Development Commands

```bash
# Build React app and sync with iOS
npm run ios:build

# Open the iOS project in Xcode
npm run ios:open

# Run on iOS simulator directly
npm run ios:run

# Build and open in one command
npm run ios:dev
```

### iOS Project Structure
```
ios/
â”œâ”€â”€ App/                   # iOS app project
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.xcodeproj     # Xcode project
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App/              # App source files
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public/       # Web assets (auto-generated)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Podfile           # CocoaPods dependencies
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Building for iOS

1. First build the React app: `npm run build`
2. Sync with Capacitor: `npx cap sync ios`
3. Open in Xcode: `npx cap open ios`
4. In Xcode, select your target device/simulator and click "Run"

### Troubleshooting iOS

- If you get Node.js version errors, this project uses Capacitor v6 which is compatible with Node 18+
- Make sure CocoaPods is installed: `gem install cocoapods`
- If pod install fails, try: `cd ios/App && pod install --repo-update`
