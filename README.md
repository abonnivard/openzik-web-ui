## ðŸ”‘ Authentication

Authentication is handled using **JWT**, stored on the frontend.

* The token is attached in headers (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
* Some routes (e.g., `/home/recently-played`, `/home/playlists`) require a logged-in user.

## ðŸ“š Main Pages

* **Home**:

  * Recently played tracks
  * User playlists
* **Library**:

  * Downloaded or local music
* **Player**:

  * Playback controls (Play / Pause / Next / Previous)
* **Login / Register**:

  * Backend authentication (JWT)
